## 💡 Strategic Insights

- **Campaign B** outperformed Campaign A in both **conversion** and **Day 7 retention**, both statistically significant.
- Despite a slightly higher CPI, Campaign B generated **higher ROI** and better user quality.
- **Daily installs** for Campaign B show stronger momentum mid-month onward.
- Majority funnel drop-off occurs between install and purchase — indicating a key point for optimization.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Reallocate **25–30%** of Campaign A’s budget to Campaign B.
- Launch **retargeting campaigns** for users who install but don’t convert.
- Segment future campaigns by user type (device, region, source).
- Track **weekly retention cohorts** for long-term performance.
